## Boundary Conditions (Butterfly Valve)
This code (butterflyValve) is a boundary condition used in hydro monitor (SOW-131) and exhaust duct (SOW-133). It dis implemented in OFv7. It is used to open a valve at a specified time and at a specified opening rate. 

## Postprocess data to make histogram chart
These two codes (histogramPP and histogram_Tonly) are independant codes. They will read results of OF and produce historgram distribution data. 

## rhoReactingFoam
The only change to this code is adding rho to the output file.
